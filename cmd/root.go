	Long: `This tool secures the sensitive file(s) in your git repository.
	
This tool achives this in a simple and innovative manner of encrypting given file line by line.
This helps in making diff work while remaining compatible to git diff.
There are several usecases where this tool can be used.
  * Obsidian: markdown based note taking app (Second Brain),
  * Public Password store without taking any third party paid service,
  * All files related to a service in one repository, hence easier and simpler CI/CD.
  * Please add more if you can think of more usecases.
